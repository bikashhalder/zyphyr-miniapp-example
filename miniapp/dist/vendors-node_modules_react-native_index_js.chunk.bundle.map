The props will be merged in the order the `StatusBar` components were\n * mounted.\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * For cases where using a component is not ideal, there are static methods\n * to manipulate the `StatusBar` display stack. These methods have the same\n * behavior as mounting and unmounting a `StatusBar` component.\n *\n * For example, you can call `StatusBar.pushStackEntry` to update the status bar\n * before launching a third-party native UI component, and then call\n * `StatusBar.popStackEntry` when completed.\n *\n * ```\n * const openThirdPartyBugReporter = async () => {\n *   // The bug reporter has a dark background, so we push a new status bar style.\n *   const stackEntry = StatusBar.pushStackEntry({barStyle: 'light-content'});\n *\n *   // `open` returns a promise that resolves when the UI is dismissed.\n *   await BugReporter.open();\n *\n *   // Don't forget to call `popStackEntry` when you're done.\n *   StatusBar.popStackEntry(stackEntry);\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * There is a legacy imperative API that enables you to manually update the\n * status bar styles. However, the legacy API does not update the internal\n * `StatusBar` display stack, which means that any changes will be overridden\n * whenever a `StatusBar` component is mounted or unmounted.\n *\n * It is strongly advised that you use `pushStackEntry`, `popStackEntry`, or\n * `replaceStackEntry` instead of the static methods beginning with `set`.\n *\n * ### Constants\n *\n * `currentHeight` (Android only) The height of the status bar.\n */\nclass StatusBar extends React.Component        {\n  static _propsStack             = [];\n\n  static _defaultProps      = createStackEntry({\n    backgroundColor:\n      Platform.OS === 'android'\n        ?

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable={true}\n *         maxLength={40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline={true}\n *          numberOfLines={4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border\n * has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it\n * cannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this is to either not set height\n * explicitly, case in which the system will take care of displaying the border\n * in the correct position, or to not display the border by setting\n * `underlineColorAndroid` to transparent.\n *\n * Note that on Android performing text selection in input can change\n * app's activity `windowSoftInputMode` param to `adjustResize`.\n * This may cause issues with components that have position: 'absolute'\n * while keyboard is active. To avoid this behavior either specify `windowSoftInputMode`\n * in AndroidManifest.xml ( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html )\n * or control this param programmatically with native code.\n *\n */\nfunction InternalTextInput(props       )             {\n  const {\n    'aria-busy': ariaBusy,\n    'aria-checked': ariaChecked,\n    'aria-disabled': ariaDisabled,\n    'aria-expanded': ariaExpanded,\n    'aria-selected': ariaSelected,\n    accessibilityState,\n    id,\n    tabIndex,\n    selection: propsSelection,\n    selectionColor,\n    selectionHandleColor,\n    cursorColor,\n    ...otherProps\n  } = props;\n\n  const inputRef = useRef                     (null);\n\n  const selection             =\n    propsSelection == null\n      ? null\n      : {\n          start: propsSelection.start,\n          end: propsSelection.end ?? propsSelection.start,\n        };\n\n  const text =\n    typeof props.value === 'string'\n      ? props.value\n      : typeof props.defaultValue === 'string'\n        ? props.defaultValue\n        : undefined;\n\n  const viewCommands =\n    AndroidTextInputCommands ||\n    (props.multiline === true\n      ?

I'm sorry for this.\n\n      This is a hack. Ideally we would forwardRef to the underlying\n      host component. However, since TextInput has it's own methods that can be\n      called as well, if we used the standard forwardRef then these\n      methods wouldn't be accessible and thus be a breaking change.\n\n      We have a couple of options of how to handle this:\n      - Return a new ref with everything we methods from both. This is problematic\n        because we need React to also know it is a host component which requires\n        internals of the class implementation of the ref.\n      - Break the API and have some other way to call one set of the methods or\n        the other. This is our long term approach as we want to eventually\n        get the methods on host components off the ref. So instead of calling\n        ref.measure() you might call ReactNative.measure(ref). This would hopefully\n        let the ref for TextInput then have the methods like `.clear`.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\n\nconst States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the responder\n

It makes\n * single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to\n * recognize simple multi-touch gestures.\n *\n * By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block\n * long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.\n *\n * It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the\n * [gesture responder system](docs/gesture-responder-system.html).\n * For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the\n * native event object:\n *\n * ```\n * onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}\n * ```\n *\n * A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:\n *\n *  - `nativeEvent`\n *      + `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event\n *      + `identifier` - The ID of the touch\n *      + `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event\n *      + `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation\n *      + `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen\n *\n * A `gestureState` object has the following:\n *\n *  - `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least\n *     one touch on screen\n *  - `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `vx` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `vy` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen\n *\n * ### Basic Usage\n *\n * ```\n *   componentWillMount: function() {\n *     this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n *       // Ask to be the responder:\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *\n *       onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows\n *         // what is happening!\n *\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}\n *\n *         // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y}\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The user has released all touches while this view is the\n *         // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture\n *         // should be cancelled\n *       },\n *       onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS\n *         // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.\n *         return true;\n *       },\n *     });\n *   },\n *\n *   render: function() {\n *     return (\n *       <View {...this._panResponder.panHandlers} />\n *     );\n *   },\n *\n * ```\n *\n * ### Working Example\n *\n * To see it in action, try the\n * [PanResponder example in

When two touches move in parallel five\n   * pixels in the same direction, the cumulative distance is five, not ten. If\n   * two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other\n   * touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.\n   *\n   * This logic requires a kind of processing of time \"clusters\" of touch events\n   * so that two touch moves that essentially occur in parallel but move every\n   * other frame respectively, are considered part of the same movement.\n   *\n   * Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:\n   *\n   * - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is\n   *   invalid.

If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance.

This is\n   * to (at least) handle the case where the user is moving three fingers, and\n   * then one of the fingers stops but the other two continue.\n   *\n   * This is very different than taking all of the recently moved touches and\n   * storing their centroid as `dx/dy`. For correctness, we must *accumulate\n   * changes* in the centroid of recently moved touches.\n   *\n   * There is also some nuance with how we handle multiple moved touches in a\n   * single event. With the way `ReactNativeEventEmitter` dispatches touches as\n   * individual events, multiple touches generate two 'move' events, each of\n   * them triggering `onResponderMove`. But with the way `PanResponder` works,\n   * all of the gesture inference is performed on the first dispatch, since it\n   * looks at all of the touches (even the ones for which there hasn't been a\n   * native dispatch yet). Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.
